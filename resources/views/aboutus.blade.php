  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p> At Metropolitan Montessori School, the child is at the center of our work and the guide to our purpose. We are dedicated to providing an inclusive, enriching, nurturing and rigorous environment where each child is seen as capable and encouraged to grow to their fullest potential academically, emotionally and socially. The dynamic partnership of child, parent and teacher creates a consistent Montessori framework offering “An Education for Life.” </p>
